# SheLaunch: Digital Business Hub for Women Entrepreneurs

## Problem Statement
Many women entrepreneurs face challenges when trying to establish an online presence. Building a website often requires technical skills or hiring expensive developers, which can be difficult for small-scale or new business owners. This limits their visibility, customer reach, and growth opportunities. Additionally, managing products, content, and analytics can be overwhelming for someone without prior experience.

We want to solve this problem by creating a simple, adaptive, and intelligent platform that allows women entrepreneurs to quickly launch and manage their businesses online without any coding skills. The platform should reduce the time, cost, and complexity of building a professional website while providing guidance to make their online presence effective and appealing.
